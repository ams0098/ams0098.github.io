### Employment History
* Research Associate      Sep. 2016 – present
* Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States.
Projects:
* Decision Support Framework for Investment in Risk Mitigation and Maintenance of Electric Power Systems Subjected to Natural Hazards
* Developing an asset management strategy for electric power system structural components considering strength deterioration and climate change impact. 
* Developing a multi-criteria decision framework for risk mitigation for electric power systems subjected to hurricane hazards. 
* NSF Multi-agent sustainable water decision theory (MUST): nexus of water, road, and hierarchical social contractual systems 
* Modelling the interdependency of water system and road system (which provides mobility of people and goods while generating loads on the water pipes via mechanical and environmental processes).
* Formulation of an advanced decision model that builds on a large repository of data to support water-related decisions at different levels (water department and community levels).

* Doctoral Research				Sep. 2014 – Aug. 2016 
* Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, United States.
* Research advisor: Dr. Yue Li							 
* Dissertation title: Risk-based Assessment and Hardening of Electric Power Systems Subjected to Natural Hazards 
* Developing a framework for evaluating system reliability and cost-effectiveness of targeted hardening strategies of power distribution systems subjected to hurricanes. 
* Developing a framework for studying the effectiveness of enhancing the reconfigurability of distribution systems subjected to hurricanes.
* Studying the impact of climate change on hurricane risk assessment of power distribution systems and effectiveness of various adaptation strategies.
* Developing a framework for multi-hazard risk assessment of electric power systems and studying the effectiveness of various multi-hazard mitigation strategies.

* Masters Research                Aug. 2012 – May 2014
* Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, United States.
* Research advisor: Dr. Yue Li                                                                        	                                 
* Thesis title: Age-dependent Fragility and Life-cycle Cost Analysis of Timber and Steel Power Distribution Poles Subjected to Hurricanes 
* Developed a probabilistic framework for comparing wood and steel power distribution poles in terms of structural reliability and cost.

* Undergraduate Honors Research           Mar. 2010 – Jan. 2011
* Curtin University, Malaysia Campus
* Thesis title: Study on High Strength Concrete with Low Calcium Fly Ash and Lime
* Used over 200 concrete samples to study the effectiveness of using lime to improve the strength and durability of high strength low calcium fly ash concrete.
